# Overview

Leveraging the [PsychoJS](https://www.psychopy.org/online/index.html) library, we expose a utility package that can generate nodejs and docker projects to host a custom psychojs project on the web, 
allowing CSV file uploads via NodeJS and multer.

# Before Using

You should take some time to read the high-level documentation for psychojs, linked above. At a minimum, check the [compatibility table](https://www.psychopy.org/online/status.html) to make sure that all the psychopy features you need are supported in psychojs. Some things are at the mercy of the framework and others are at the mercy of browser and web limitations. This utility does not try to fix or maintain these frameworks, just make using them easier.

# Usage

Usage of this project is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, and requires only a few steps to get started (this guide assumes windows but should be easily translatable to any OS):

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.6+)
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Launch `git bash` (from start menu or desktop) [windows only]
1. Install this package using pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/iandavis0527/PsychoJSGenerator.git`
1. Generate a template for your project: `create-psychojs-project {project_name}`


# Project Overview
The newly created project will have several template and complete files provided for you, in the following structure:

```
project
│   server.js
│   server_config.json
│   package.json
│   package-lock.json
│
└───experiment
│   │   project.js
│   │   wrapper.js
│   │   index.html
│   │
│   └───lib
│       │   psychojs-2021.2.3.js
│       │   psychojs-2021.2.3.css
│       │   ...
│   
└───results
    │   ...
```

These are the key files to note (in order of areas that you will likely change):

- `experiment/project.js`: This file will be named after your project, and this should be the file that psychopy builder generates when you hit "build javascript". For ease of use, you can keep all your psychopy project files in the `experiment` folder.
- `server_config.json`: Configuration file for the server, you won't need to edit this except to change the port that the server listens on or where result CSVs that get uploaded get saved.
- `experiment/index.html`: The main HTML file served by the NodeJS server. You should not need to edit this as the main thing it does is include your experiment/project.js file.
- `package.json`: The npm package definition file, you should not need to edit this. It contains required dependencies for your server to run.
- `server.js`: The core NodeJS server file, you should not need to edit this. You can run `npm run start` to run the server locally, and access your experiment from your browser at http://localhost:3000
- `experiment/wrapper.js`: This script wraps some psychojs functions to allow us to upload experiment results as CSV to the node server. You should not need to edit this file.
- `package-lock.json`: NPM package lock file, you should **NOT** edit this file. It is generated by npm when installing dependencies.


# Troubleshooting

One area of uncertainty with this wrapper relies on the version of psychojs that is being targeted. 
It seems that the psychojs repository version (currently 2021.2.1) lags behind the main psychopy version (currently 2021.2.3).
For the sake of compatibility, the generator clones the [psychojs github repository](https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs/blob/main/src/data/index.js) and targets a specific revision, 
the HEAD of the repo at the time of writing this tool (02/16/2022).
This tool then directly remaps the 2021.2.1 version to 2021.2.3 by default.
In the future, the builder may target newer and newer versions, and this version replacement will no longer work properly.

To account for this in a new project, you can use the {psychojs_version} parameter of the `create-psychojs-project` script. 
The call listed in the usage section would then become: `create-psychojs-project {project_name} {psychojs_version}`

In an existing project built with this tool, you will need to do two things:
1. rename all the files inside of `experiment/lib/` -- `psychojs-2021.2.3 -> psychojs-{psychojs_version}`
1. edit `index.html` and again rename all references `psychojs-2021.2.3 -> psychojs-{psychojs_version}`
