# Overview

Leveraging the [PsychoJS](https://www.psychopy.org/online/index.html) library, we expose a utility package that can generate nodejs and docker projects to host a custom psychojs project on the web, 
allowing CSV file uploads via NodeJS and multer.

# Usage

Usage of this project is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, and requires only a few steps to get started:

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Install python (3.6+)
1. Install this package using pip (will require a mindmodeling login and added as a collaborator to this repo): `pip install git+https://git.mindmodeling.org/ian.davis/PsychoJSGenerator.git`
